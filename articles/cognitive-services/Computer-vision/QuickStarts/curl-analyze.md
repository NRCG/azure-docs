# Quickstart: Analyze a remote image using the REST API and cURL in Computer Vision

In this quickstart, you analyze a remotely stored image to extract visual features by using Computer Vision's REST API. With the [Analyze Image](https://westcentralus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/5adf991815e1060e6355ad44/operations/56f91f2e778daf14a499e1fa) method, you can extract visual features based on image content.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/ai/?ref=microsoft.com&utm_source=microsoft.com&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=cognitive-services) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

- You must have [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se/windows).
- You must have a subscription key for Computer Vision. To get a subscription key, see [Obtaining Subscription Keys](../Vision-API-How-to-Topics/HowToSubscribe.md).

## Create and run the sample command

To create and run the sample, do the following steps:

1. Copy the following command into a text editor.
1. Make the following changes in the command where needed:
    1. Replace the value of `<subscriptionKey>` with your subscription key.
    1. Replace the request URL (`https://westcentralus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/vision/v2.0/analyze`) with the endpoint URL for the [Analyze Image](https://westcentralus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/5adf991815e1060e6355ad44/operations/56f91f2e778daf14a499e1fa) method from the Azure region where you obtained your subscription keys, if necessary.
    1. Optionally, change the language parameter of the request URL (`language=en`) to use a different supported language.
    1. Optionally, change the image URL in the request body (`http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3c/Shaki_waterfall.jpg\`) to the URL of a different image to be analyzed.
1. Open a command prompt window.
1. Paste the command from the text editor into the command prompt window, and then run the command.

```console
curl -H "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: <subscriptionKey>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" "https://westcentralus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/vision/v2.0/analyze?visualFeatures=Categories,Description&details=Landmarks&language=en" -d "{\"url\":\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3c/Shaki_waterfall.jpg\"}"
```

## Examine the response

A successful response is returned in JSON. The sample application parses and displays a successful response in the command prompt window, similar to the following example:

```json

  "categories": [
    {
      "name": "outdoor_water",
      "score": 0.9921875,

      }
    }
  ],
  "description": {
    "tags": [

      "giraffe",
      "field"
    ],
    "captions": [
      {
        "text": "a large waterfall over a rocky cliff",
        "confidence": 0.916458423253597
      }
    ]
  },
  "requestId": "b6e33879-abb2-43a0-a96e-02cb5ae0b795",
  "metadata": {
    "height": 959,

    "format": "Jpeg"
  }
}
```

## Clean up resources

When no longer needed, close the command prompt window and the text editor.

## Next steps

Explore the Computer Vision API used to analyze an image, detect celebrities and landmarks, create a thumbnail, and extract printed and handwritten text. To rapidly experiment with the Computer Vision API, try the [Open API testing console](https://westcentralus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/5adf991815e1060e6355ad44/operations/56f91f2e778daf14a499e1fa/console).
